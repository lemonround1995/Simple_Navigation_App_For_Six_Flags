This program is based on the map of Six Flags Magic Mountain. It generates navigation instructions for 21 attractions
that act as node for the generated graph. The graph consists of couple of nodes that have directed edges. This program
also informs about the alternative paths if the visitor is handicapped. Additionally, a visual presentation of graph
is generated as an output where each node is named and color-coded according to its attributes.

>Data files used: node.csv, edge.csv, edge_incomplete.csv
>Python files used: magic_map.py, MagicLA.py

Data File Description:
1. node.csv
> This csv file consists of 4 columns:
    1. id - attraction number as per the original map.
    2. name - name of the attraction
    3. type - type of attraction ( E / S / F)
    4. minimum_height - height of the attraction

2. edge.csv and edge_incomplete.csv
> This csv file consists of 5 columns:
    1. u_node - starting point of navigation
    2. v_node - end point of navigation
    3. weight - weight assigned to each edge ( Most of them calculated using Google maps, rest of them are assumed
    relatively.
    4. if_accessible - the value for this column is "Y" if the path is accessible for handicapped visitors,
    otherwise "N".
    5. if_directed - the value for this column is "Y" if the path is directed, otherwise "N".
Note: Difference between edge.csv and edge_incomplete.csv is that some edges have been removed in the later one to
validate the automated test.
